## Usage

- **Open Image**: Load an image file to convert.
- **Draw Image**: Open a drawing window. Use the brush or eraser, adjust thickness, then convert to ASCII.
- **Filters**: Toggle and adjust filters on the left. The ASCII art updates live.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copies the ASCII art for use elsewhere.

## Technical Details

- **Image Processing**: Uses Pillow for resizing, grayscale, and filter effects.
- **ASCII Mapping**: Each pixel's brightness is mapped to a character in `@%#*+=-:. `.
- **Live Update**: Changing any filter or parameter instantly refreshes the ASCII output.
- **Drawing**: The draw window uses a PIL image as a canvas, synced with the Tkinter canvas for real-time drawing and erasing.
- **UI**: Tkinter frames organize the layout. Custom colors and fonts create the Matrix vibe.
